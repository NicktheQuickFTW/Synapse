# FlexTime System Prompt Integration

This document describes the integration of the comprehensive FlexTime system prompt into the XII-OS FlexTime module. The system prompt provides detailed guidance for the FlexTime scheduling system, ensuring it delivers optimized, competition-ready schedules for the Big 12 Conference.

## Changes Made

1. **Added System Prompt to `prompts.js`**:
   - Created a new `flexTimePrompt` object in the prompts file
   - Added the comprehensive system prompt text
   - Properly exported the prompt through the module.exports

2. **Updated Agent Utilities in `agent-utils.js`**:
   - Modified the agent customization functions to incorporate the FlexTime system prompt
   - Updated the agent initialization process to automatically include the system prompt
   - Created two new agent generation functions for:
     - COMPASS Integration agent (`createCompassIntegrationAgent`)
     - Head Coach agent (`createHeadCoachAgent`)

3. **Created Utility Files**:
   - `utils.js`: General utility functions used throughout the FlexTime module
   - `compass-integration.js`: Functions to integrate with the COMPASS module for geographical and travel data
   - `config/config.js`: Configuration settings for the FlexTime module

4. **Fixed Implementation Issues**:
   - Commented out references to undefined functions
   - Ensured proper directory structure for the module
   - Created a verification script to confirm successful implementation

## System Prompt Overview

The integrated system prompt defines FlexTime as an advanced sports scheduling intelligence system with a clear mission and execution process. It provides:

1. **Structured Approach**: A clear 5-phase process from sport configuration to final output
2. **Constraint Hierarchy**: Prioritized application of constraints (religious, academic, venue, etc.)
3. **Optimization Logic**: Multi-factor optimization loops with over 1,000 iterations
4. **Output Generation**: Comprehensive schedule formats and analytics
5. **Behavioral Guidelines**: Instructions for how the system should interact with users

## Verification

The successful integration of the FlexTime system prompt was verified using the `verify-flextime-prompt.js` script, which confirmed:

1. The existence of the system prompt in the prompts.js file
2. Proper export of the FlexTime prompt through the module.exports

## Next Steps

To fully utilize the FlexTime system prompt:

1. **Complete Agent Implementation**: Implement the actual agent functionality beyond the current placeholder code
2. **Resolve Storage Issues**: Address the "no space left on device" error encountered during testing
3. **Create Single-File Agents**: Develop or obtain the missing agent scripts referenced in the configuration
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Create a more thorough test suite to verify the full functionality

## Conclusion

The FlexTime system prompt has been successfully integrated into the XII-OS FlexTime module, providing a solid foundation for advanced sports scheduling capabilities. The prompt's detailed guidance will ensure the system can effectively generate optimized, competition-ready schedules for the Big 12 Conference.
