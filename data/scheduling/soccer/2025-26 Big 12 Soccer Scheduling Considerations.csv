,"DIFFERENCES: A-1 vs. A-2 - The A-2 version includes playing certain teams twice in a season and is one fewer match overall.  
A-1 vs C - The A-1 version is a slight nod toward geography from C as it includes three protected opponents. C would most likely have 1 or 2 ""protected"" depending on team.
Coaches discussed A-1 and A-2 and did not support A-2 (don't like playing same team twice in a season).",,

OTHER DISCUSSION by SWAs,,,
RS Championship,"Is a regular-season champion meaningful if playing less than 50% of membership (Option A-2)? In any option, can go straight W-L record for RS champion or could explore using KPI to determine champion and to seed for  championship.",,
