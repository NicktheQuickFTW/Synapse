OTHER DISCUSSION by SWAs,,
RS Championship,"Is a regular-season champion meaningful if playing different number of opponents (Option A)? In either case (A or C), can go straight W-L record for RS champion or could explore using KPI to determine champion and to seed for  championship.",
Neutral Site,Asked about playing multiple matches at neutral site. This would actually increase travel from what is presented in Option A as neutral site matches would replace home match(es).,
