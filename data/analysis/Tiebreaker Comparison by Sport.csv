MEN'S GOLF,"Team ties shall be broken according to the NCAA tiebreaking procedure to determine the team champion only. 

Individual ties will not be broken. Should a tie occur at the medalist position, co- or multiple medalists will be named.  

If weather permits, ties at the individual champion position will be broken by a playoff for NCAA automatic qualification purposes. 

If the players tied are all from the same team, the playoff occurs at the coach’s discretion but the coach must indicate to the Conference who the Automatic Qualifier is. 

If the weather does not allow for a playoff, the following steps will be utilized to identify the AQ: 
1) A student-athlete from a team that will not qualify for NCAA competition will be the Conference AQ. 
2) If there is more than one student-athlete whose team is not anticipated to qualify for NCAA competition, the highest-ranked individual according to the Golfweek/Sagarin national rankings will be named the Conference AQ.","Tiebreak Procedures (From Appendix A of NCAA Men's Golf Prechampionship Manual)

"EQUESTRIAN

(NCEA followed)","1) In the case of an overall team tie; a tiebreaker utilizing the western equivalency formula will be used.  It is western discipline score total multiplied by 2.5 minus 100 multiplied by the number of counted scores. WE = ((score)2.5) - (100*(number of scores)).  Number of scores must reflect the total number of scores used in the summation (a score per judge).
2)The first tiebreaker when the overall point totals are the same is: (jumping seat raw scores) + (WE) with the highest summation of the two teams winning. The second tiebreaker when the overall point totals are the same is: (jumping seat raw scores- one low drop score) + (WE- one low drop score) with the highest summation of the two teams winning.","1) In the case of an overall team tie; a tiebreaker utilizing the western equivalency formula will be used.

WRESTLING,"2021 Process: The NCAA does break team ties at the national tournament, and the tiebreaking procedure listed in the NCAA Rule Book (to right) covers Dual Meets and Team-Advancement Tournaments.  However, in talking with the NCAA Wrestling Secretary-Rules Editor during last season’s Big 12 Championship when it looked like a team tie was possible, he informed that Conference Qualifying Tournaments (i.e. The Big 12 Wrestling Championship) are not considered Team-Advancement Tournaments, and therefore the tiebreaking procedure would not be applicable.  Since this is the first time it happened at our Championship, we did reference the Big Ten to see how they may have treated team ties at their Conference Championship, and they too have recognized co-champions.  ","Section 21. Breaking Ties in Dual Meets and Team-Advancement Tournaments
When two teams finish in a tie in a dual meet or a team-advancement tournament, the following criteria shall be applied to determine a winner:
a. Greater number of victories. 
Note: Forfeits, defaults and disqualifications count toward total number of victories.
b. Combined total number of falls, forfeits, defaults and disqualifications.
c. Total match points scored only from decisions, major decisions and technical falls.
d. Total near fall points scored only from decisions, major decisions and technical falls. (Example: N-2 + N-2 + N-4 = Total of 8 near fall points scored for one team.)
e. Total number of takedowns scored only from decisions, major decisions and technical falls. (Example: T-2 + T-2 + T-2 = Total of 3 takedowns scored for one team.)
f. Least number of unsportsmanlike conduct calls.
g. First takedown scored in the dual meet.
One team point shall be awarded to the team winning by criteria. The method of recording the score in breaking team ties shall be the score followed by the  criterion number that broke the tie (for example, Team A 17, Team B 16, criterion 3.21.a.)"
GYMNASTICS,"In the event of a tie at the conclusion of the Big 12 Gymnastics Championship, the tied teams shall be named Co-Champions.","From NCAA Gymnastics Prechampionship Manual (and OU experienced this at NCAA):

competition on Friday.
Ties — Nationals
• Day 1 — Semifinals (team competition): Ties for second place in each semifinal will be broken by counting six scores per event. If a tie still exists, the team score will be determined by using six scores per event, dropping the high and low scores, and adding the four middle scores.
